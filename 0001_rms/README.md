Given a sequence of numbers, calculate the _root mean square_ (also called the _RMS_) of the values.

The **root mean square** is calculated by summing the _squares_ of all the values,
dividing by the total number of values (i.e., taking the _mean_ of the _squares_),
and then taking the square root.
